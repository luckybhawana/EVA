	<p> <h4> Introduction </h4></p>
	<br>
	
	<p> <h4>
	Thank You for choosing EVA. This is our Privacy Policy.<br>
	Before getting into the the details, we would like to <br>
	highlights some of the key principles. These principles are <br>
	very important to us because we know they are very valuable to you.
	<br>
	<br>
	The Privacy Policy is here to explain three things: <br>
	
	1. The way we use the information that you share  <br>
		with us inorder to build a great product and give you <br>
		a great experience with it; <br>
		<br>
	2. Ensure that you understand what information we collect <br>
		with your permission, and what we do - and do not do - with it; <Br>
		<br>
	3. Hold us accountable for protecting your rights and your privacy<br>
		under this policy.
	<br>
	<br>
	
	All the information we collect is related to provide the EVA services and its features
	
	<br>
	<br>
	
	Commonly speaking, there are two type of information we collect: <br>
	1) information that we must have in order for you to use EVA; and <br>
	2) information that we can use to provide additional features <br>
	<br>
	
	The first type of information includes:<br>
	<br>
	* Registration information, including your first name, <br>
	  last name, email address and other information you provide <br>
	  when you sign up for EVA.<br>
	<br>
	
	* Broad, non-specific location, which we drive from your IP address.<br>
	  Inorder to find the store that is closer to the location of an event, <br>
	  we need to know the country and location your in.<br>
	<br>
	
	* Technical and sensor information necessary to operate EVA. 
	  This includes the type of browser and device, data from the <br>
	  touchscreen, and information fom your device's accelerometer <br>
	  and gyroscope sensors. This enalbes you to control EVA and allows <br>
	  to do simple things like to display the past events and upcoming events. <br>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  
	 The Second type of information that allows us to offer you additional features<br>
	 <br>
	 
	 * Your specific location: We will never gather or use your specific device <br>
	   location without first getting your explicit permission. This information allows <br>
	   us to recomment you more local store and such.
	   <br>
	   <br>
	   
	 * Your photos: We will only access images that you specifically choose, and we will <br>
	   neve scan or import your photo library or camera roll. This allows you to choose <br>
	   individual pictures to change your profile picture. 
	   <br>
	   <br>
	   
	 * Your contacts: We will never scam or import your contacts unless you ask us to.<br>
	   If you choose to do so, we will only use contact information to help you find store <br>
	   and business onwer near your location.
